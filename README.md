# WessleyMitchell.NeuralNetwork

In my desire to learn more about neural networks, I decided to write a feed-forward neural network.  This project is the result of all I've observed after my time of study.  I'm committing it to GitHub in the hope that someone else will find it useful for instruction.

I'm still learning, and it's very possible some part of the network's code could be improved.  I am open to issues and pull requests.
